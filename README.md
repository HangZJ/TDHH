# Network-Wide Routing-Oblivious Heavy Hitters source code (TDHH)
This repository contains the source code of the "Network-Wide Routing-Oblivious Heavy Hitters", by Ran Ben Basat, Gil Einziger, Shir Landau Feibish, Jalil Moraney, and Danny Raz (ACM/IEEE ANCS 2018).

Implementation was done by Jalil Moraney (jalilm[at]cs.technion.ac.il), 2018.

This code performs volume estimation, frequency estimation, and heavy hitter detection, as described in the paper. The code works on several real-life traces and can be easily extended to other traces.
